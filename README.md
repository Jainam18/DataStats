# Fuel Futureâ€™s Price Predictive Analysis - Data, Statistics and Information Final Project

## Introduction
This project explores trading behaviors of key commodities, focusing on identifying patterns, volatility, and factors influencing price movements. The study employs statistical methods and predictive modeling to derive actionable insights for investors, analysts, and policymakers.

## Research Questions
1) Average Closing price of different Commodities:
Is there a significant difference between the average closing prices of different fuel commodities?
Is the average closing varying a lot across different commodities

2) Market Response to Trading Volume:
How are trading volume and price volatility connected in the fuel market?
Explores if high trading activity coincides with significant price fluctuations.

3) Predicting Next-Day Price Movement:
Time Series modeling or Linear Regression which approach performs better in predicting the next day's closing price based on previous data?
Uses trading patterns to provide actionable insights for decision-making.

## Dataset

Open source data on kaggle available which is free to use -

## Results
* Highest Volatility: Brent Crude Oil showed the highest volatility in trading volume, followed by RBOB Gasoline and Heating Oil.
* Correlations: Strong relationships exist between Crude Oil and Brent Crude Oil, while Natural Gas demonstrated weaker correlations.
* Predictive Modeling: A linear regression model performed exceptionally well (R-squared = 0.999), identifying intraday change and short-term moving averages as key predictors.
* Seasonality: Natural Gas and RBOB Gasoline exhibit clear seasonal trends.

## Conclusion

The findings reveal significant price and volume variations among commodities, with Brent Crude Oil standing out for its volatility. Predictive models proved effective but require further refinement to address high forecast errors in volatile commodities. Tailored forecasting strategies, including seasonality-aware approaches, are recommended for enhanced accuracy and robustness.
